[Eric Yu's Blog](http://www.erickyu.com) - A Personal Blog Project
==================================================================

This is my first attempt at making a blog system using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.JS). It is purely for educational/practice purposes and is by no means polished at all. I am a newbie at all of the elements in the stack so bear with me.

Please make sure you set the environment variable MONGOHQ_URL on your platform! (or replace it with the appropriate MongoDB access string)

This blog is inspired by [Brian Ford's tutorial](http://http://briantford.com/blog/angular-express.html). However, the starting point was the Angular seed, with Express added manually.
