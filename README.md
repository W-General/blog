[Eric Yu's Blog](http://www.erickyu.com) - A Personal Blog Project
==================================================================

This is my first attempt at making a blog system using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.JS). It is purely for educational/practice purposes and is by no means polished at all. I am a newbie at all of the elements in the stack so bear with me.

The MongoDB database link has been removed in the repo and has been replaced with [omitted]. So if you need to use it, just replace [omitted] with your own MongoDB string.

This blog is inspired by [Brian Ford's tutorial](http://http://briantford.com/blog/angular-express.html). However, the starting point was the Angular seed, with Express added manually.
